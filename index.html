                    <h1>Synopsis</h1>
                    <p>In this delightful French film Amelie (played by Audrey Tautou)is a lonely waitress <br> with a heart of gold. When Amelie
                    discovers a box of old treasures in the floorboards <br> of her apartment, she decides to track down the owner and reunite
                    him with his box <br> of childhood memories. The gratitude of the owner and the happiness that Amelie <br> sees on his face spurs
                    her on to commit further random acts of kindness. <br> Amelie decides to play matchmaker for a lonely co-worker and a jilted
                    man who <br> frequents the restaurant where she works. In order to motivate her father to spread <br> his wings, Amelie steals his
                    prized garden gnome and photographs the gnome <br> in front of various landmarks from around the world. Amelie's actions pay
                    off when <br> her father makes the decision to travel the world. When Amelie sees a disabled <br> grocer's assistant being
                    degraded and humiliated by his boss, Amelia sneaks into <br> the boss' apartment and delivers a hilarious comeuppance. When
                    Amelie meets the <br> handsome and enigmatic Nino, she secretly sends him notes and acts as a secret <br> admirer, never revealing
                    herself. As Amelia watches Nino from afar she is fascinated <br> by the way he picks up discarded pieces from photobooths all
                    over Paris. <br> Who is leaving these fragments of pictures. And why? As Amelia works towards <br> uncovering this mystery she
                    gathers the courage to reveal herself to Nino.</p>
